    "The graph displayed above shows the Mannhold log(P) as a function of the molar mass of the molecules present in the csv file. The Mannhold log(P) is a measure of how hydrophobic (water-repellent) a molecule is. One the right side of the graph, there is a scale of the hydrophobicity. A dark blue colour indicates very low hydrophobicity, i.e. high hydrophilicity whereas a dark red colour indicates gigh hydrophobicity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most of the molecules are found in a lower molar mass range between 0 and 2000 g/mol, with hydrophobicity values (LogP) between 0 and 10. This shows that smaller molecules can have a wide range of hydrophobic properties. Even though these smaller molecules show a variety of behaviors, there is a clear grouping of molecules with low molar mass and moderate hydrophobicity, meaning that small molecules can still be fairly hydrophobic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger molecules with molar masses between 3000 and 8000 g/mol, there are less data points. These molecules tend to have a more consistent hydrophobicity, mostly at 0 or 10 showing less variety. This suggests that larger molecules, while still hydrophobic, donâ€™t vary as much in their water-repelling properties compared to smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one noticeable exeption with a Mannhold LogP around 50 and a molar mass close to 3000 g/mol. This molecule is extremely hydrophobic compared to the others."

    "### Correlation Heatmap Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation heatmap shown above represents the pairwise relationships between various molecular properties. Each square in the heatmap reflects the correlation coefficient between two variables, which can range from -1 to +1:\n",
    "- **+1**: Strong positive correlation (both variables increase together).\n",
    "- **0**: No correlation (the variables are independent).\n",
    "- **-1**: Strong negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases).\n",
    "\n",
    "The heatmap uses a color gradient to display correlations, where:\n",
    "- **Red**: Positive correlation\n",
    "- **Blue**: Negative correlation\n",
    "- **White**: No correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps Taken in the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Various molecular descriptors were calculated for a dataset of compounds. These descriptors are features commonly used in cheminformatics for predicting molecular properties and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: The molecular data was processed to ensure that the variables were standardized, and any missing values were handled appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Correlation Calculation**: Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients were computed between all pairs of molecular descriptors. These values show how the variables are linearly related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**: A heatmap was created to visually represent these correlations. The color gradient helps identify both positive and negative relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Positive Correlations**:\n",
    "  - Certain descriptors such as **Hydrogen Bond Acceptors** and **Fragment Complexity** appear to have strong positive correlations, indicating that an increase in one likely leads to an increase in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative Correlations**:\n",
    "  - Variables like **Rotatable Bonds Count (non-terminal)** and **SP3 Character** show negative correlations with others, suggesting that as one increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero/Weak Correlations**:\n",
    "  - Many of the variables, such as **XLogP** and **Aromatic Atoms Count**, display weaker correlations with other descriptors, indicating that these are relatively independent factors in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remark**:\n",
    "    - One should note that this distribution is symmetric with respect to the 100% correlation diagonal (going from the top left side to the bottom right)\n",
    "This visual representation is a powerful way to quickly identify relationships between multiple variables in your dataset, which can inform further analysis or modeling efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The heatmap provides a clear visual guide to how molecular descriptors interact with each other. This analysis can be further used to select or eliminate certain features in predictive modeling, based on their redundancy or independence. For example, descriptors that are highly correlated (red regions) may provide similar information and could be considered for dimensionality reduction, whereas descriptors with low or no correlation might offer unique insights into molecular properties."
